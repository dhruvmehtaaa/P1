        <h1>Tribute To Doctors</h1><hr>
        
        <p> The COVID-19 pandemic in India is a part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of 17 August 2021, according to official figures, India has the second-highest number of confirmed cases in the world (after the United States) with 32.2 million reported cases of COVID-19 infection and the third-highest number of COVID-19 deaths (after the United States and Brazil) at 432,079 deaths.
            However these figures exhibit severe under-reporting.</p>
            <p> The first cases of COVID-19 in India were reported on 30 January 2020 in three towns of Kerala, among three Indian medical students who had returned from Wuhan, the epicenter of the pandemic.Lockdowns were announced in Kerala on 23 March, and in the rest of the country on 25 March. On 10 June, India's recoveries exceeded active cases for the first time.
                Infection rates started to drop in September, along with the number of new and active cases.Daily cases peaked mid-September with over 90,000 cases reported per-day, dropping to below 15,000 in January 2021. A second wave beginning in March 2021 was much more devastating than the first, with shortages of vaccines, hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and other medical supplies in parts of the country.By late April, India led the world in new and active cases. 
                On 30 April 2021, it became the first country to report over 400,000 new cases in a 24-hour period.Experts stated that the virus may reach an endemic stage in India rather than completely disappear;in late August 2021, Soumya Swaminathan said India may be in some stage of endemicity where the country learns to live with the virus.</p>
         <p> India began its vaccination programme on 16 January 2021 with AstraZeneca vaccine (Covishield) and the indigenous Covaxin. Later, Sputnik V and the Moderna vaccine was approved for emergency use too.
             As of 17 August 2021, the country had administered over 550 million vaccine doses.</p>

            <h4>Second Wave</h4>
            <p>The second wave of COVID-19 in India has had severe consequences in the form of spiralling cases, reduced supplies of essential treatments, and increased deaths particularly in the young population.
                Understanding why the second wave has been more dangerous than the first could help to identify the potential areas of diagnostics to target with future control strategies.</p>
<p>During the second wave in India, many cases of mucormycosis, also known as the black fungus, have been reported in patients with diabetes and patients with COVID-19, as well as patients who were recovering from infection. The excessive use of steroids in the treatment of COVID-19 and immunosuppression by the virus led to the emergence of this opportunistic fungal infection.5 Although cases of black fungus were reported during the first wave, cases during the second wave have become more prominent in many cities of India, leading state governments to declare this too as an epidemic. As of June 7, 2021, the Indian Ministry of Health had recorded 28 252 cases of black fungus. 
The risk of the white fungus Aspergillosis—assumed to be even more fatal than the black fungus—is also on the rise with some cases reported in parts of India.</p>
<p>Patients in the first wave infected with SARS-CoV-2 were predominantly older than 60 years and those with comorbid conditions were at increased risk of death. However, surprisingly, younger adults appear to be prone to infection during this latest cycle and many patients have died at a young age, including patients aged between 25 and 50 years.</p>
<p>The reason why the younger population is now more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 is not apparent and beyond current scientific explanations.</p>

            <h4>Corona Warriors</h4>
    
        <p> There are 800 doctor deaths that the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has counted in the second wave of Covid-19 this year. A majority were from Bihar and Delhi, as per the IMA, which has maintained a state-wise registry of doctors who died of Covid-19.</p>
        <p>To date, the IMA data shows that more than 1,500 doctors have died of Covid-19. The IMA has declared ‘Save the Saviours’ as the theme of this year’s National Doctors’ Day, which is observed on July 1.</p>
    <p>Dr Jayesh Lele, secretary general of IMA headquarters, told The Indian Express that studies were underway and information was being collected from each state regarding the number of doctors who had succumbed and the number of doctors who had been administered either one or both doses.</p>
    <p> “So far, we have the data of 800 doctors in our registry and initial observations indicate that a majority were yet to be fully vaccinated. Not many had got the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine,” Dr Lele said, adding that they were also looking at data where young doctors had succumbed to Covid-19 and, among primary reasons, could be exposure to high viral load in ICUs or CCUs. He, however, said the analysis was underway.</p>
    <p> According to the state-wise list of doctors who died in the IMA Covid registry, 128 medicos were from Delhi, 115 from Bihar and 79 from Uttar Pradesh, who succumbed to the infection. West Bengal reported 62 deaths of doctors followed by 51 in Tamil Nadu, 44 in Rajasthan, 42 in Andhra Pradesh, 39 each in Gujarat and Jharkhand, 37 in Telangana, 36 in Odisha, 24 in Kerala and 23 in Maharashtra. Haryana reported 19 deaths while Assam reported 10.
        Last year, the toll among this high-risk group was 754. Then, the highest numbers were from Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.</p>
    <p> According to Dr Rohan Krishnan, national vice-president of Federation of All India Medical Association (FAIMA), there was no data on how many doctors had died after being administered one dose of the vaccine. “However, according to available information, it is likely that few would have succumbed after both doses of vaccination. There were, however, several doctors who did get infected after the dose but 99 per cent recovered,” he said.</p>
    <p>While across the country, doctors’ associations will observe Doctors’ Day either by organising blood donation camps or vaccine drives, some like FAIMA will work for another three extra hours for free.</p>
